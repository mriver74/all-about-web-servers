<h2>New&#8482 and Flashy&reg;</h2>
<p>&emsp;With the rise of the large, global, interconnected server network known as the cloud in the twenty-first century, trends seem to be changing for web server hosting. Companies, in an effort to try and find more effective web hosting solutions, began to use the cloud to host servers in a practice known as <b>cloud computing</b>. Instead of hosting applications on a single, physical server, cloud hosting spreads the data across many different virtual servers across the world. This form of computing allows for increased scalability and flexibility, as instead of being limited by a single server's limitations, many different servers can process the information at once.</p>
<p>&emsp;Another benefit to cloud hosting is the price, which is generally more affordable. While current server plans make customers buy a fixed amount of space that they might not use all of, cloud hosting only charges based on the amount of resources used. Companies nowadays are also looking towards hybrid hosting on both public and private clouds. Public clouds are web services, including web servers, that are managed by a third-party provider, whereas private clouds are dedicated and managed by a single company. Hybrid hosting takes both of these services, and uses the best of both, where companies keep their sensitive data on web servers in their private cloud, and use web servers on a public cloud to facilitate trade and commerce. According to a recent report by Flexera, 79% of companies either have or are already using hybrid hosting during daily operations. As such, one may logically deduce that hybrid hosting solutions are quickly going to become the norm, and possibly could even replace traditional forms of server hosting within the decade.</p>

<h2>All about our AI Overlords</h2>
<p>&emsp;Another technological trend that is changing how web servers are run is the implementation of <b>artificial intelligence</b>. Managing web servers has always been a difficult task, as server administrators would have to allocate potential resources, install software updates, consistently monitor the health of servers, and manage hardware and software issues.  However, artificial intelligence has begun to solve this problem head on. Unlike humans, who need data to be structured and presented in a certain way in order to be understandable, artificial intelligence is able to work with raw data and process it at speeds far outmatching that of human capacity.</p>
<p>&emsp;With these upsides, AI models can scan multiple web servers at greater efficiency, and can even predict issues before they arise. Another issue is that the hardware of web servers also needs to be maintained at optimal conditions for long periods of time, with server farms consuming a lot of energy and producing a lot of heat. Artificial intelligence models, however, have also been shown to predict temperature spikes, modify cooling schedules, manage power grids efficiently, reroute excess power, and compute optimal schedules to reduce noise pollution. As such, many companies have shown interest in implementing artificial intelligence into their web servers.</p>
