<h2>Handy-Dandy Cheat Sheet</h2>
<p>As a basic overview, I have listed <b>seven fundemental concepts</b> of web servers and why they are important. Now you won't be caught off-guard if someone on the street asks you about silly things such as "server-side architecture" or some other techno-jargon term!</p>

<ol>
<li><b>Hardware</b>: Hardware is the physical parts and components of the computers systems that run servers, rather than the digital applications on them. There are a myriad of different parts with different functions, such as the GPU, RAM, CPU, etc; without them, there is no machine for the web server to run on.</li>
<li><b>Software</b>: Software is the digital appplications and code of the computer systems that run servers, rather than the physical parts themselves. These applications and systems are critical in allowing web servers to actually function in the first place.</li>
<li><b>HTTP Protocol</b>: The Hypertext Transfer Protocol is, essentially, a set of rules which all computer servers follow in order to communicate. The protocol itself allows servers to request and recieve resources, and is made up of multiple layers, each with their own funciton.</li>
<li><b>Client-Server Model</b>: The Client-Server Model is a crucial part of HTTP that allows computers to communicate in the first place. Basically, it's the architecture where computers are clients which requests information from servers which hold the applications and data.</li>
<li><b>Web Hosting</b>: Web Hosting is the practice of hosting websites on the internet which allow users to access requested  information or services. There are many different types of web hosting models, from shared models to virtual private models.</li>
<li><b>Domain Name System</b>: Domain Name System, or DNS, is the naming service that takes numerical IP addresses and translates them into user-friendly domain names. It is also used to connect email servers together and serves as a sort of phonebook of the Internet.</li>
<li><b>Static and Dynamic Content</b>: Website content can be displayed in one of two ways: static (which will stay the same for all users all the time) or dynamic (which displays in real time differently depending on actions, location, or other factors relating to a user).</li>
