<h2>What is a Web Server?</h2>
<p>&emsp;A web server, put simply, is computer software that stores and distributes data through the usage of <b>Hypertext Transfer Protocol</b>, otherwise known as <b>HTTP</b>. When users access web pages, they will use HTTP (or HTTPS) to request a web server for a given resource; web servers then either respond to the request, or return an error code on why the request was not fulfilled. Furthermore, web servers can be split up into two different sections: hardware and software. Web server hardware is what connects to the internet and stores incoming/outgoing data. The physical hardware of the computer is made up of many intricate components, such as network interface cards, random access memory, and storage drives. By using HTTPS, these computers are able to store documents, images, and files; web server software is then used to access this information.</p> 
<p>&emsp;The software, unlike the hardware, is responsible for displaying the actual content itself, which is accessed through domain names. Able to be accessed through URLs, the web server software is also able to use different types of protocols other than HTTPS, such as Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (or SMTP) and File Transfer Protocol (or FTP). The standards of web servers are set by a Request for Comments, or an RFC. Created by the Internet Engineering Task Force (or IETF), RFCs are published works dedicated to standardizing internet protocols, like HTTP and DNS. The first RFC relating to the World Wide Web was released in 1996; It mainly focused on HTTP/1.0, and by increasing the maximum amount of concurrent connections, it helped web servers increase their long term scalability. In 2015, a new RFC, HTTP/2, forced most popular web server owners to switch to the protocol, and in effect helped lower the amount of TCP/IP connections. This new standard led to faster accessing of major web servers, and increased the amount of strain said web servers could handle at a time. The most current RFC, HTTP/3, runs on a different protocol called the User Datagram Protocol, unlike the previous version which only ran on TCP; this protocol emphasizes speed over stability, and currently 30% of of the top ten million websites use this protocol, with that number steadily growing everyday.</p>

<h2>In the Beginning</h2>
<p>&emsp;In order to understand the history of the web server, one must first understand the history of the World Wide Website project. In 1989, a man by the name of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee">Sir Tim Berners-Lee</a> proposed a project to his superiors at CERN, also known as the European Organization for Nuclear Research. His goal was a simple one: to exchange information and data between scientists using a hypertext system. Over the next year, Berners-Lee and his team created three different software libraries and programs which were each installed on local CERN workstations. This prototype of the World Wide Web only consisted of a graphical browser, a line-mode web browser, and a web server known as “CERN httpd”, all of which was written the very primitive HTTP 0.9. With this proof of concept, Berners-Lee released the source code of the programs to the public in August of 1991, encouraging people to experiment and adapt the technology into their own operating systems.</p> 
</p>&emsp;By December of the same year, the first web server outside of Europe was installed in the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center in the United States, marking the first step towards global web communication. In April of 1993, CERN released the three software components into the public domain, relieving web developers of any sort of legal worries over tampering with CERN’s source code. By 1994, Netside had been released by Netside, and by 1995 the Information Information Services was released by Microsoft, marking the entry point of the company that would eventually come to dominate the computer market. By 1995, the number of web servers was at 100,000, and by 1996 this jumped to 600,000; this trend of rapid growth of web servers would only continue to grow exponentially into the turn of the millennium, and has been increasing ever since.</p>
